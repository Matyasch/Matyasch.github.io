I am a PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab (AMLab)](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/people/MatyasSchubert/) supervised by [Sara Magliacane](https://saramagliacane.github.io) and [Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/). I am mainly interested in reinforcement learning methods that can discover and utilize causal information about their environment.
